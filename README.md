# 🤖 Multi-Agent System: Goal-Driven Information Enrichment

This project is a modular **multi-agent system** built in Python that takes a user goal (e.g., _“Find the next SpaceX launch, check weather at that location, and summarize if it may be delayed”_), then:

✅ Plans  
✅ Routes data  
✅ Calls public APIs  
✅ Enriches step-by-step results  
✅ Generates a final answer
